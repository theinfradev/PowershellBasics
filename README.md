# PowershellBasics
In this repo i am exploring basic constructs and disciplines

**Functions.ps1**   - is designed to show how to create a clearly written function that is verbose but ultimately clear in it's input.

**OneInOneOut.ps1** - is designed to to show how to create a complex contract and make sure that your function returns a complex object.                         The purpose of this is to make your input/output simpler and allow coupling between functions while allowing for                           variability in the implementation between the contracts.
